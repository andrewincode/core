style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waterproofing in both positive and negative pressure at the same time has never been so easy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WatStop is a unique material which is able to protect against any type of water infiltration, even when it is coming from the outside, such as on the underground walls and rooms. It is a three-components product composed by epoxy resin, special cement with some aggregates and a catalyst.Easily applied by trowel, roll or brush onto many different substrates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to its high level of waterproofing resistance, 9.5 ATM in negative and positive pressure, WatStop can be applied onto underground walls and extremely difficult and critical situations, such as cellars, pit of lifts, garages. It also works as a vapour barrier over concrete floors, to avoid problems of rising dampness and to protect the following coating layers that will be applied over the floor. It is also suitable for waterproofing swimming pools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watstop works with an extremely low thickness: just 2 mm. For this reason it is a superb solution whenever it is impossible to install rougher materials. Moreover, it can be coated by many different materials, such as plasters, smoothers, paints, coatings (acrylic, epoxy and PU), tiles.</span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","vendor":"Sustainable Earth Designs","product_type":"Water Proofing","created_at":"2021-04-04T07:37:13-06:00","handle":"watstop","updated_at":"2023-02-14T13:35:00-06:00","published_at":"2023-02-09T13:28:55-06:00","template_suffix":"","status":"active","published_scope":"web","tags":"main product","admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/Product/6602352984254","variants":[{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":39482903167166,"title":"Default Title","price":"888.00","sku":"","position":1,"inventory_policy":"continue","compare_at_price":null,"fulfillment_service":"manual","inventory_management":null,"option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"created_at":"2021-04-04T07:37:13-06:00","updated_at":"2023-02-14T13:35:00-06:00","taxable":true,"barcode":"","grams":0,"image_id":null,"weight":0,"weight_unit":"kg","inventory_item_id":41577076097214,"inventory_quantity":88,"old_inventory_quantity":88,"requires_shipping":true,"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductVariant/39482903167166"}],"options":[{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":8482768388286,"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}],"images":[{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":31094103441598,"position":1,"created_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:21-06:00","updated_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:32-06:00","alt":null,"width":251,"height":201,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/images_81c1cd3d-5fe5-4ae2-ac9b-49815911283f.jpg?v=1652915312","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/31094103441598"},{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":28235896193214,"position":2,"created_at":"2021-04-04T07:37:15-06:00","updated_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:32-06:00","alt":null,"width":800,"height":409,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/Watstop.png?v=1652915312","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/28235896193214"},{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":28235896225982,"position":3,"created_at":"2021-04-04T07:37:15-06:00","updated_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:32-06:00","alt":null,"width":594,"height":720,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/Watstop1.png?v=1652915312","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/28235896225982"},{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":28235896160446,"position":4,"created_at":"2021-04-04T07:37:14-06:00","updated_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:32-06:00","alt":null,"width":593,"height":744,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/Watstop2.png?v=1652915312","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/28235896160446"},{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":28235896258750,"position":5,"created_at":"2021-04-04T07:37:15-06:00","updated_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:23-06:00","alt":null,"width":815,"height":627,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/Certifications_8aca54e9-d1a7-419c-804c-62c0e40cdc91.png?v=1652915303","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/28235896258750"},{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":32800614088894,"position":6,"created_at":"2022-12-11T17:08:28-06:00","updated_at":"2022-12-11T17:08:28-06:00","alt":null,"width":1920,"height":700,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/Diasen-download-impermeabilizzanti.jpg?v=1670800108","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/32800614088894"}],"image":{"product_id":6602352984254,"id":31094103441598,"position":1,"created_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:21-06:00","updated_at":"2022-05-18T17:08:32-06:00","alt":null,"width":251,"height":201,"src":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/2723/5006/products/images_81c1cd3d-5fe5-4ae2-ac9b-49815911283f.jpg?v=1652915312","variant_ids":[],"admin_graphql_api_id":"gid://shopify/ProductImage/31094103441598"}}]'); let  cusEve = new CustomEvent('added'); document.dispatchEvent(cusEve); });
